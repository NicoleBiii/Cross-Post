# Project Title

Social Media Aggregator: A Unified Content Management Platform
## Overview


This app is a centralized social media management tool that allows users to post content, reply to messages, and manage interactions across multiple platforms, including TikTok, Twitter (X), Instagram, and YouTube. The goal is to streamline social media engagement for influencers and businesses by reducing the effort required to maintain multiple accounts.

### Problem Space

Managing multiple social media accounts is time-consuming and inefficient. Influencers and businesses must log into different platforms separately to post content, check messages, and respond to comments. This process can lead to delays in engagement and difficulty in maintaining a consistent online presence. Our app addresses these pain points by offering a unified interface for cross-platform posting and interaction management.

### User Profile

Primary Users:

Social media influencers who manage accounts across multiple platforms.

Small businesses and content creators looking to streamline social media engagement.

User Needs:

Ability to schedule and publish posts across different platforms simultaneously.

Unified notification and messaging system for engagement tracking.

### Features

Multi-Platform Posting: Users can create a post once and publish it across TikTok, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube.

Comment & Message Management: A centralized inbox to view and respond to DMs and comments.
